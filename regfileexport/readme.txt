Using RegFileExport
===================

RegFileExport is a console application designated to be used by advanced
users. RegFileExport accept 2 - 3 parameters, according to the following
syntax:

RegFileExport [Registry File] [Destination .Reg File] {Registry Key}

{Registry Key} is optional, if the key is specified, only this key and
all its subkeys will be exported into the .reg file. Otherwise, the
entire file will be exported.
if [Destination .Reg File] is an empty string ("") the Registry data will
be sent to the standard output.

Examples:
RegFileExport "E:\Windows\system32\config\SOFTWARE." "f:\temp\reg1.txt"
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion"
RegFileExport "SOFTWARE" "" "Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion"
RegFileExport "NTUSER.DAT" "ntuser-reg.txt"
RegFileExport "NTUSER.DAT" "ntuser-reg.txt"
"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion"




More Information
================


* RegFileExport can also export secret data that is only available for
  'SYSTEM' account, like the password/security information stored in
  SECURITY and SAM Registry hives.
* RegFileExport cannot export Registry data of your currently loaded
  operating system, because these files are locked by Windows.
* On Windows XP - If you want to extract Registry infromation from
  previous restore points, you can find the Registry files of every
  restore point under C:\System Volume
  Information\_restore{guid}\RPxxx\snapshot. However, you must change the
  permissions of this folder in order to access these files, or
  alternatively, you can run cmd.exe as a SYSTEM account (with 'at'
  command), and then you'll be able to access this folder and the
  Registry files that are stored in it. Be aware that the _restore{guid}
  subfolder also has 'hidden' attribute.
