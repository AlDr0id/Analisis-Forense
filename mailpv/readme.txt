Using the Mail PassView utility
===============================

This utility is a standalone executable. It doesn't require any
installation process or additional DLLs. Just run the executable
(mailpv.exe) and watch the list of your email accounts. You can save the
accounts information into a text file or copy them to the clipboard.




Getting email passwords from another instance of Windows ?
==========================================================

Many people ask me whether it's possible to extract the email passwords
from an external instance of Windows that cannot boot.
For now, Mail PassView can only retrieve the passwords from external
drive for Mozilla Thunderbird, Netscape, and Eudora. It's possible that
external drive support for more email applications will be added in the
future. In order to do that, you must go to 'Select Folders/Files' window
(F6) and manually select the right folders in the external drive.



Translating Mail PassView to other languages
============================================

Mail PassView allows you to easily translate all dialog-boxes, menus, and
strings to other language.
In order to do that, follow the instructions below:
1. Run Mail PassView with /savelangfile parameter:
   mailpv.exe /savelangfile
   A file named mailpv_lng.ini will be created in the folder of Mail
   PassView utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all menus, dialog-boxes, and string entries to the
   desired language.
4. After you finish the translation, Run Mail PassView, and all
   translated strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run Mail PassView without the translation, simply
   rename the language file, or move it to another folder.
